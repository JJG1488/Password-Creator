## Foresight

This website will stay up to date with current semantics and implementation of JavaScript. Any one can use this page as a quick way to get a password generated.

---

## Incentive

JavaScript is a powerful language and this webpage was built to show of some of the capabilities of JavaScript.

---

## Challenges

As with writing any problem, it is sometimes difficult to foresee user input that threatens to break your code or program. Trying to anticipate what a user will enter can sometimes leave your application vulnerable until it is broken.

---

## Reasoning

This project was built to generate a random password for anyone that may need one generated.

---

## Solution

In this project I learned that there is more than one approach to do the same thing. Logic is vital to every application/ project.

---

## Take away

JavaScript is not complicted to implement as long as the logic behind it is clear and concise.
